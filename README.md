general setup steps i took:
 - provision a database (i use azure sql server)
 - provision azure logic apps as webhook handlers to feed up-to-minute changes in work items and contacts to your database
 - subscribe to karbon work items and contacts webhooks sending the response to your azure logic app webhook handler
 - run python scripts to request data from the karbon api to seed your database with initial data
