              "description": "Avrio Solutions, LLC (“firm,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is pleased to provide {{hidden:client_name}} (“you” or “your”) with the professional services described below. \n\nThis letter and any other attachments incorporated herein (collectively, “Agreement”) confirm our understanding of the terms and objectives of our engagement and the nature and limitations of the services we will provide. The terms of the Agreement will govern the engagement between you and our firm.\n\n\n*Engagement Objective and Scope*\nWe will prepare your Federal Form 1040 and any associated state income tax forms for the year ending December 31, 2021\n\nWe will only prepare the tax returns identified above after receiving the requested information indicating your acceptance of this Agreement. We will prepare your tax returns based on the information and representations you provide to us. We have not been engaged to and will not prepare financial statements. We will not audit or otherwise verify the data you submit to us, although we may ask you to clarify certain information.\n\nAs identified above, we will prepare the above-referenced tax returns solely for filing with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state and local tax authorities. Our work is not intended to benefit or influence any third party, either to obtain credit or for any other purpose.\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any and all claims arising from the use of the tax returns for any purpose other than filing with the IRS and state and local tax authorities regardless of the nature of the claim, including the negligence of any party.\n\nOur engagement does not include any procedures designed to detect errors, fraud, or theft. Therefore, our engagement cannot be relied upon to disclose such matters. In addition, we are not responsible for identifying or communicating deficiencies in your internal controls. You are responsible for developing and implementing internal controls applicable to your operations.\n\nThis engagement is limited to the professional services outlined above.\n\n*CPA Firm Responsibilities*\nUnless otherwise noted, we will perform our services per the Statements on Standards for Tax Services (“SSTSs”) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) and U.S. Treasury Department Circular 230 (“Circular 230”). We must perform services with the same standard of care that a reasonable tax return preparer would exercise in this type of engagement. It is your responsibility to safeguard your assets and maintain accurate records of transactions. We will not hold your property in trust for you or otherwise accept fiduciary duties in the performance of the engagement.\n\nWe will prepare your tax returns based upon your filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, or qualifying widow[er] with dependent child) as reflected in your income tax returns for last year. If your filing status has changed, you wish to change your filing status, or you have questions about your filing status, please contact us immediately.\n\n_Confidentiality_\nIf the tax returns prepared in connection with this engagement are filed using the married filing jointly filing status, both spouses are deemed clients of the firm under the terms of this Agreement. Both individuals acknowledge that there is no expectation of privacy from the other spouse concerning our services in connection with this Agreement. We are at liberty to share with either of you, without the prior consent of the other, documents and additional information concerning the preparation of your tax returns.\n\n\n_Estimated tax payments_\nYou may be required to make quarterly estimated tax payments. We will calculate these payments for the 2022 tax year based on your information to prepare your 2021 tax returns (the “safe harbor” rule). Updating recommended payments to more closely reflect your actual current year’s income is not within the scope of this engagement. If you would like us to provide this service, we will confirm this update in a separate engagement letter.\n\n_Tax planning services_\nTax planning services are not within the scope of this engagement. While preparing the tax returns identified above, we may bring to your attention potential tax savings strategies for you to consider as a possible means of reducing your taxes in subsequent tax years. However, we have no responsibility to do so and will take no action concerning such recommendations, as the responsibility for implementation remains with you, the taxpayer. We will confirm this representation in a separate engagement letter if you ask us to provide tax planning services.\n\n_Government inquiries_\nThis engagement does not include responding to any governmental agency or tax authority inquiries. If your tax return is selected for examination or audit, you may request our assistance in responding to such an inquiry. We will confirm this representation in a separate engagement letter if you ask us to represent you.\n\n_Third-party requests_\nWe will not respond to any request from banks, mortgage brokers, or others to verify any information reported on these tax returns. We do not communicate with third parties or provide them with copies of tax returns.\n\n*Client Responsibilities*\nWe will provide you with an income tax organizer to help you compile and document the information necessary to prepare your income tax returns. You must complete the income tax organizer with accurate and complete information. Income from all sources, including those outside the U.S., is required.\nWe rely upon the accuracy and completeness of the information and other supporting data you provide to render professional services.\n\n_Documentation_\nYou are responsible for maintaining adequate documentation to substantiate the accuracy and completeness of your tax returns. You should retain all documents that provide evidence and support for reported income, credits, and deductions on your returns, as required under applicable tax laws and regulations. You are responsible for the adequacy of all information provided in such documents. You represent that you have such documentation and can produce it, if necessary, to respond to any audit or inquiry by tax authorities. You agree to hold our firm harmless from any liability, including but not limited to additional tax, penalties, interest, and professional fees resulting from the disallowance of tax deductions due to inadequate documentation.\n\n_Gift Tax Returns_\nThe IRS considers a gift to be any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full consideration (measured in money or money’s worth) is not received in return. Under federal tax law, certain gifts are taxable and subject to an annual gift tax exclusion amount, which for 2021 is $15,000 per taxpayer. You are responsible for informing us if gift tax returns must be filed. We will confirm this representation in a separate engagement letter if you ask us to prepare these returns.\n\n_Gifts received from foreign persons_\nSuppose you received a gift or bequest from a foreign person or trust. In that case, you might be required to file a separate IRS Form 3520, Annual Return To Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts, or 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust with a U.S. Owner. If you ask us to prepare this return, we will confirm this in a separate engagement letter.\n\n_Personal expenses_\nYou are responsible for ensuring that personal expenses, if any, are segregated from business expenses and that expenses such as meals, travel, vehicle use, gifts, and related expenses are supported by necessary records required by the IRS and other tax authorities. At your written request, we can provide you with written answers to your questions on the types of supporting records required.\nState and local filing obligations\n\nOn June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the long-standing physical presence nexus standard in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., et al. This decision significantly changed the landscape of sales and use tax compliance, especially for online sellers. If you wish to understand the decision’s impact on your business, we will confirm this in a separate engagement letter. The scope of our services under this engagement letter does not include services related to your compliance with other tax obligations.\n\nYou are responsible for determining your tax filing obligations with any state or local tax authorities, including but not limited to income, franchise, sales, use, property, or unclaimed property taxes. If, upon review of the information you have provided to us, including information that comes to our attention, we believe that you may have additional filing obligations, we will notify you. You acknowledge that any other filing obligations are not within the scope of this engagement. We will confirm this representation in a separate engagement letter if you ask us to prepare these returns.\n\n_U.S. filing obligations related to foreign investments_\nAs part of your filing obligations, you may be required to make certain information disclosures related to your foreign investments. You are responsible for informing us of all foreign assets owned directly or indirectly, including but not limited to financial accounts with foreign institutions and ownership of any foreign entities, regardless of amount.\n\nBased on the information you provide, you may have additional filing obligations including but not limited to:\n•\tOwnership of or an officer relationship to certain foreign corporations (Form 5471);\n•\tForeign-owned U.S. corporation or domestic disregarded entity (Form 5472);\n•\tForeign corporation engaged in a U.S. trade or business (Form 5472);\n•\tU.S. transferor of property to a foreign corporation (Form 926);\n•\tU.S. person with an interest in a foreign trust (Forms 3520 and 3520-A);\n•\tU.S. person with interests in a foreign partnership (Form 8865); or\n•\tU.S. person with interests in a foreign disregarded entity (Form 8858).\n\nIf we believe you have additional filing requirements, we will discuss them with you before completing your tax return.\n\nIn addition, as part of your filing obligations, you are required to report the maximum value of specified foreign financial assets, which include financial accounts with foreign institutions and certain other foreign non-account investment assets that exceed certain thresholds.\n\nBased upon the information you provide, we will use this data to inform you of any additional filing requirements, which may include Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Assets, FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank, and Financial Accounts (“FBAR”). The FBAR is not a tax return, and its preparation is not within the scope of this engagement. If you ask us to prepare the FBAR, we will confirm this representation in a separate engagement letter.\n\nFailure to timely file the required forms may result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information regarding any foreign investments you have a direct or indirect interest in or over which you have signature authority during the above-referenced tax year. \n\nThe foreign reporting requirements are very complex. If you have any questions regarding applying the reporting requirements for your foreign interests or activities, please ask us. We assume no liability for penalties associated with the failure to file or untimely filing of any of these forms.\n\n_Virtual Currency_\nThe IRS considers virtual currency (e.g., Bitcoin) as property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, any transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency are subject to the same general tax principles that apply to other property transactions.\n\nIf you had virtual currency activity during the tax year, you may be subject to tax consequences associated with such transactions and may have additional reporting obligations. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information regarding any transactions in, or transactions that have used, virtual currency during the applicable tax year.\n\n_Other income, losses, and expenses_\nIf you realized income, loss, or expense from a business or supplemental income or loss, the reporting requirements of federal and state income tax authorities apply to such income, loss, or expense. You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations about such operations, including classifying workers as employees or independent contractors and related payroll tax and withholding requirements.\n\n_Ultimate responsibility_\nYou have final responsibility for the accuracy of your tax returns. As applicable, we will provide you with a copy of your electronic tax returns and accompanying schedules and statements for review before filing with the IRS and state and local tax authorities. You agree to review and examine them carefully for accuracy and completeness.\n\nYou will be required to verify and sign a completed Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization, and any similar state and local equivalent authorization form before your returns can be filed electronically. If you do not sign Form 8879, we will require you to come to our office to pick up your returns so that you can mail the returns to the appropriate filing authorities.\n\nIf you do not wish to have your tax returns filed electronically, please contact our firm. Additional procedures will apply. You will be responsible for reviewing the paper returns for accuracy, signing them, and filing them timely with the tax authorities.\n\n*Timing of the Engagement*\nWe expect to begin our services after we receive your 2021 income tax documents and information.\n\nOur services will conclude upon the earlier of:\n•\tthe filing and acceptance of your 2021 tax returns by the appropriate tax authorities and mailing or delivery of non-electronically filed tax returns (if any) for your review and filing with the relevant tax authorities,\n•\twritten notification by either party that the engagement is terminated, or \n•\tone (1) year from the execution date of this Agreement.\n\n*Extensions of Time to File Tax Returns*\nDue to the high volume of tax returns prepared by our firm, the information needed to complete the tax returns must be received no later than March 15, 2022, so that the returns may be completed by the original filing due dates.\n\nIt may become necessary to apply for an extension of the filing deadline if there are unresolved issues or delays in processing or if we do not receive all of the required information from you on a timely basis. Applying for an extension of time to file may extend the time available for a government agency to undertake an audit of your return or may extend the statute of limitations to file a legal action. All taxes owed are due by the original filing due date. Additionally, extensions may affect your liability for penalties and interest or compliance with governmental or other deadlines.\n\nTo the extent you wish to engage our firm to apply for extensions of time to file tax returns on your behalf, you must notify us of this request, preferably in writing. Our firm will not file these applications unless we receive your express written authorization to file for an extension. In some cases, you may need to sign such applications before filing. Failure to timely request an extension of time to file can result in penalties for failure to file tax returns, which accrue from the original due date of the returns and can be substantial.\n\nWe are available to discuss this matter with you at your request. Additional charges will apply for such services.\n\n*Penalties and Interest Charges*\nFederal, state, and local tax authorities impose various penalties and interest charges for non-compliance with tax laws and regulations, including failure to file or late filing returns and underpayment of taxes. You, as the taxpayer, remain responsible for the payment of all tax, penalties, and interest charges imposed by tax authorities.\n\nWe rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information you provide to us in connection with the preparation of your tax returns. Failure or inadequate disclosure of income or tax positions may result in penalties and interest charges.\n\n\n*Professional Fees*\nOur professional fee for the services outlined above is based upon the complexity of the work to be performed and our professional time, as well as out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, this fee depends upon the timely delivery, availability, quality, and completeness of the information you provide to us. You agree that you will deliver all records requested and respond to all inquiries made by our staff to complete this engagement on a timely basis. You agree to pay all fees and expenses incurred whether or not we prepare the tax returns.\nWe appreciate the opportunity to serve you. To accept our firm’s offer to perform services based on the terms outlined in this Agreement, forward the completed tax questionnaire, documents, and other tax return information we request to us. By doing so, you agree to be bound by the terms set forth above."
